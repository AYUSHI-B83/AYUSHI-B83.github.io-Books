    “A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.”  For most people, nothing beats the feeling you get when you cozy up on your couch with a book in hand. A good book can transport you into a world you didn’t know existed. As the quote goes, “you open a book, you open a new world.”The core – and perhaps unexpected – thing that books do for us is simplify. It sounds odd, because we think of literature as sophisticated. But there are powerful ways in which books organise, and clarify our concerns – and in this sense simplify.This site attains to maintain the decorum for all the book lovers by containing all the genre specific to bestsellers list updated and compiled.It's for all the book lovers out there who want to keep themselves updated about books.
